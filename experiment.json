    "description": "Similar to the normal n-back task where subjects must press a button if the current stimulus is the same as the stimulus presenting n trials previously. It is adaptive in the sense that the n varies based on performance. If the subject does very well, the n is increased. This allows the task to adjust to the abilities of the subject. There are many implementations of the basic n-back. Our plan is to use one that requires you to match letters regardless of capitalization 'B' and 'b' would be a match. This avoids some problems with perceptual/familiarity strategies.",
